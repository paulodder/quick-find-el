#+TITLE: quick-find.el

Tiny framework to facilitate quickly jumping to custom-defined directories
(both locally and remote locations).

Define names and corresponding directories as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq quick-find-name2dir '(("emacs.d" . "~/.emacs.d")
                            ("home" . "~/")
                            ("remote/hostname" . "/ssh:<user>@<hostname>:/home/<user>/")))
#+END_SRC

The following two interactive functions are defined:
* =quick-find-file=
Prompts you with a list of names (as defined in =quick-find-name2dir=) to
choose from, and runs =find-file= in the directory corresponding to the chosen
name.

* =quick-find-file-as-root=
Prompts you with a list of names (as defined in =quick-find-name2dir=) to
choose from, and runs =find-file= in the directory corresponding to the chosen
name but with a prefix so that any file you open is opened as root.

* setting up
Clone this repo in =~/.emacs.d/=
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/paulodder/quick-find-el
#+END_SRC
Add path to that repo to your =load-path= variable
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/quick-find-el")
(require quick-find)
#+END_SRC

* key-bindings
I chose the following key-bindings, but see what works for you
| =quick-find-file=         | =C-x C-j=   |
| =quick-find-file-as-root= | =C-x C-M-j= |
